2025/10/24/ 14:38 - Turns out, the problem (The image elozetes-nezt-meg didn't want to work with the CSS) wasn't even an issue! I just had to wait a few minutes. I should have waited for the deployment to finish! 

2025/10/24/ 14:43 - Came to conclusion, that I might add one or two more big design updates, then only bug fixes. This site's purpose is only as a test for GitHub.

2025/10/24/ 14:50 - Not the big update yet! Just a little improvement! Turns out, I didn't need that separate not(:hover) because I could just put it in the base img:hover as transition: transform 0.72s ease-in-out; in the img:hover and it would've been enough.

2025/10/24/ 17:58 - Fuck it. I am not making the site responsive. I-I am just done with this max-width, float bullshit. Only desktop, I don't give a fuck.

2025/10/24/ 18:04 - I gave up on responsiveness, will probably do a project where I try to master responsive websites, but I currently don't have the mental capacity to do it with this project. Update coming soon.

2025/10/24/ 18:27 - The Final Update is out. Changelog: Added credits. Nothing more. Yes, you heard that right. I have decided that a credits page is just enough for this project, and I don't need to overthink this site. It's finished.
